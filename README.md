A simple Windows tray app built with **Electron** and **Node.js** that displays your current IP-based location (City, Country) when you hover over the tray icon.

## Usage

- When launched, the app will place an icon in the Windows system tray.

## Configuration

You can adjust the **refresh interval** by modifying this line in `main.js`:

```javascript
setInterval(fetchLocation, 5 * 60 * 1000); // refresh every 5 minutes
```

For example, to refresh every 30 seconds:

```javascript
setInterval(fetchLocation, 30 * 1000);
```

## API Used

This app uses the free [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/) service to get IP geolocation data.

- No API key required for basic usage
- Fair use limits: 45 requests per minute

## Building a Standalone Executable

You can package this app as a `.exe` for Windows using [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/).

Install electron-builder:

```bash
npm install --save-dev electron-builder
```

Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"build": {
  "appId": "com.yourcompany.iplocationtray",
  "win": {
    "target": "nsis"
  }
}
```

Then build:

```bash
npm run dist
```

(Ask me if you want detailed packaging instructions.)

### Future Ideas

- Show IP address alongside location
- Detect IP change instantly instead of polling
- Auto-start on Windows boot
- Notifications when the IP or location changes
